## Project Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The Project I have created is a Memory Card Flip game with an added theme of Mortal Kombat.
The premise of this game is simple, find the matching pair of cards to win the game.

As i centered the memory game around a fighting game, I wanted to add my touches to it. By this I mean
a typical card game has a feature that tracks how much flips were made etc. In my project, i added a fight counter
which is tracked via a unmatch or a match. If the user matches cards, they are allocated 3 points.
In a fighting game a round consists of 3 rounds, so scoring 3 rounds wins you the game. I wanted to add this concept to 
my project, so by scoring a pair, you win a fight and have won 3 points.
However, by matching 2 different cards/fighters, you lose the round and lose points which will take you into the negatives.

This feature was important to add for me as I centered the project around a fighting game. So the cards represent the fighters and
the flips represent the fights won counter.
